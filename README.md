# Movie Recommendation App üé¨üçø

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation App! This application suggests movies based on user input using a cosine similarity model. It's built with Streamlit, Pandas, and scikit-learn, providing a user-friendly and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Cosine Similarity Model:** Recommends movies by calculating the cosine similarity between movies.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for a clean and intuitive user experience.
- **Robust Handling:** Deals gracefully with cases where the input movie is not found in the dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `app.py`: The main script for the Streamlit app.
- `movies_dataset.csv`: Original dataset containing movie information.
- `preprocessed_movies_dataset.csv`: Preprocessed dataset with movie titles and release years.
- `cosine_similarity_model.joblib`: Saved model for cosine similarity.
